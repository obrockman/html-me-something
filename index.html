    <h2>The Practice Gym</h2>
        <p>The love of climbing started for me while I was living and teaching English abroad in South, Korea. 
            A friend from New Zealand was a big climber and came to my city often to practice at a bouldering gym. 
            His passion for climbing and approach to the sport was contagious. So upon returning to the states, 
            one of the first things I did was find a climbing gym near me. And Ive been climbing happily since.</p>
            <h3>Korea</h3>

    <h2>Outdoor Goals</h2>
        <p>Now that Ive spent over a year in the gym I am ready to take this sport outdoors!</p>

        <p>When the weather warms up again the first place on my list is Horseshoe Canyon Ranch located in Jasper, Arkansas. Many of my friends
            have been climbing there and it has great views as well as great places for camping overnight. </p>
